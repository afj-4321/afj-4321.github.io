                    <p>Hey, If you've reached at this point of the page <br /> I hope that you enjoyed exploring my website.<br /></p>

                <p>My name is Anfaal Faisal and I am currently pursuing Computer Science in Western Michigan University in the USA, I come from Pakistan and I have lived in the Middle East all my life and have been familiarized with different cultures of
                    the world, this has not only improved my ability to think in a different way, but it has made me more aware of what the world has to offer. My main goal for making this website is to have a collection of projects that I have done over
                    my career and also represent this website as my personal portfolio. Currently I am a senior and will be graduating in Fall 2021, I aspire to be a web developer and aim to gain as much experience as I can from firms that are willing
                    to hire.
                </p>
                <p>This year I aim to indulge myself in more web development work as well as Java related projects for application development, and also aim to get into an internship, however, during this pandemic situation, a lot of internships and jobs
                    have been discontinued, so till this goes on I aim to enhance my skills in terms of coding. If you have reached till the end, thank you for visiting, and I hope that all of you are healthy and safe!</p>
